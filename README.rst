Overview
========

The tasks this week will focus on submitting assignments correctly.

Instructions
============

Run a script and create the .ipynb file for submission

.. important::

    In these exercises, you may, on occasion, come across a task that requres
    you to research or use a function or method not directly covered by the
    course text. Since Python is such a large language it would be impossible
    for the author to have included descriptions of each and every available
    function which would largely duplicate the offical Python documentation.

    A *vital* skill to successful programming is being comfortable searching
    for and using official language documentation sources like the
    `Python String Documentation`_ page. Throughout our coursework we will be
    practicing both the use of the language in practice and the search skills
    necessary to become functional programmers.

Tasks
=============



Task 01
-------

Run a simple script in your notebook

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Open a new Jupyter notebook
2.  Paste the code below and ensure it runs appropriately.  When running it, you should see a prompt asking for your name followed by a greeting once you hit the enter key.


.. code:: pycon

    >>> name = input("What is your name?")
    >>> print ("Hi, " + name)
    
 
Task 02
-------

Create a new script and download the script file

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  On a new line on your notebook (denoted by the "In [ ]" descriptor), follow the pattern above and create a script that asks for the user location.   Then, print a message stating the location back to the user (for example, "wow! i bet is cold in Boston!")

2. Click on File -> Download as -> Notebook.   Save the file as "yourName_week2.ipynb" (replace "yourName" with your name).   Then, go to Blackboard and submit this file by clicking on the assignment title link.
